# Snake Client Project

Snake game is a very popular video game. It is a video game concept where the player maneuvers a dot and grows it by ‘eating’ pieces of food. As it moves and eats, it grows and the growing snake becomes an obstacle to smooth maneuvers. The goal is to grow it to become as big as possible without bumping into the side walls, or bumping into itself, upon which it dies.

This is simply a multiplayer take on the genre.

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from here. 


## Instructions

- Run the development snake client using the `node play.js` command.
- Use the WASD keys to navigate the snake up, left, down, or right.
- Eat the red dots that appear to gain points (but this will also make your snake grow longer!).
- Colliding into walls or eating yourself will result in game over.
- Press `CTRL` + `C` to quit the game at any time.
- Good luck and have fun!
